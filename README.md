App Idea

An app that helps faciliate study buddy systems for academics. The goal is to help students who struggle with completing assignments/projects on time to improve their academic performance. Amongst a pair or small group, users can create a dynamic to-do list of homeworks, projects, assignmentthat they can update throughout the week. This list would be shared with the user's study buddy so they both can plan a timeline for how they will go about completing their items. Users can use a calendar feature to help fine tune the details of their plan. There would also be a feature for users to submit to each other photos or screenshots of their study progress. Finally, there could also be a recap feature after each stretch of planning and execution where users can reflect on what did or did not go well.
